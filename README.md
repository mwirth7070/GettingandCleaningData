Course Project

The file run_analysis.R gives has plenty of detailed comments as to what each line of code does, so if you'd like a more thorough explanation, please open the file and take a look.  In general though, what this program does is take the raw data and filters them to include just the measurements of mean and standard deviation calculations.  It then aggregates and averages them for each particular subject (1-30) and activity (there are six in total) and exports this to a txt file.
